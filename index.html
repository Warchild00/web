<h1>Who am I?</h1>
<p>I'm Warchild, or Warchild00. Im not diagnosed as a retard but i'm pretty goddamn sure I am. I like hacking video games and video games in general, and I like classic rock and rap, (old or modern) idgaf.</p>
<p>Here's the issue with owning a website, I really dunno what to put here. Maybe hacking tutorials?? I think I'm just gunna reserve this space for complaining about things and shitposting. 

<h1>Welp, let's complain!</h1>
<p>I fucking hate people that stutter. I used to have (and still have) this kid that always fucking copied me althrough elementary school. Did I mention I'm 13? Anyway, he had this stutter where he'd like copy me or some shit and I'd make an opinion, and he goes "Um uh, ummm, erm actually I suddenly agree now!1." Man that shit pisses me off so much. I tried to be nice to this kid but I fucking yelled at him so much once I got to middle school. I had this autistic kid fucking crying, and is it bad that I didn't feel bad? Idrc. --Wrote 1/31/2025</p>
<p>I also hate my generation. I have these kids in my middle school that will all copy each other to try and "fit in."
Funnily enough, I never decided to give that much of a fuck. (No I'm not some weird, nose picking kid) I also think that middle school relationships are hilarious. These mfs will go out of their way to date someone, (and not even talk to them???) then they will break up in ATLEAST 2 months. Funny asf but do whatever ig. --Wrote 1/31/2025</p>

<h1>Shut the fuck up?</h1>
<p>Ok ok, that was a lot, so let's get to some shitposting!</p>
